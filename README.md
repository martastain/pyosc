# pyosc
Python OSC server + Client

This is a fork of https://github.com/ptone/pyosc, which is fork of something else.
My personal TODO is:

 - clean-up the code, fix indentation errors etc.
 - split into multiple files, enhance readibility
 - Add missing feature (H tag for example)
 - Python 3 support
